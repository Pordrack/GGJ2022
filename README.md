# GGJ2022
Our game for the Global Game Jam 2022

/!\ This code was written for a game jam, and as such, was written in a constant hurry. Everything is absolutely disgustingly coded, with repetitions everywhere, lines skipped without reasons, useless comments and variables names written in an eldritch language that mixes french and english and absolute non sense. If you still want to read it, I'd advise you to get someone to watch you, in case anything bad happens.
